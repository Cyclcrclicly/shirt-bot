<{[precedence]}>
**PRECEDENCE**
```
Precedence is a way to organize the bot's features into a hierarchy. If a feature is on/triggered, it prevents some other features from triggering.
The precedence is:

  Commands ({prefix}help commands)
    if your message is a command, it prevents everything below from triggering

  Shirt talk ({prefix}help shirttalk)
    if your message is in a shirt talk channel, it prevents everything below from triggering
    if none of the above features are on/triggered, shirt talk can trigger

  Shirt reply ({prefix}help shirtreply)
    if your message replies to shirt bot in a shirt reply channel, it prevents everything below from triggering
    if none of the above features are on/triggered, shirt reply can trigger

  Shirt random ({prefix}help shirtrandom)
    if none of the above features are on/triggered, shirt random can trigger
```

<{[extras]}>
**EXTRAS**
```
Extras are extra features of Shirt Bot which work in shirt talk ({prefix}help shirttalk) and shirt reply ({prefix}help shirtreply). The helps for those list exactly which extras work.
Extras are:

  '#'     if your message only contains '#', Shirt Bot will try to delete the message (unless in a DM) and trigger. This allows you to trigger the bot multiple times without having to type any new messages in between.

  '# '    if your message starts with '# ', Shirt Bot will ignore the message (i.e. won't trigger), but will actually collect the message once an actual trigger occurs. This allows you to type multiple messages before triggering the bot if you wish to do that.

  '$ '    if your message starts with '$ ', it will force Shirt Bot to start its next message with the content of your message. This way, you can force Shirt Bot to say something it otherwise may not have said.
